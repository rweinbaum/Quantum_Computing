# FiveQubitCode

In this notebook, I present an implementation of the five qubit error correcting code. Section by section, various components of the five qubit code are discussed and implemented. At the end of the notebook, trials are run for various error rates and analyzed to inspect whether the recovery rate is in line with theoretical expectations.
